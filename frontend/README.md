# 🎙️ FinalCast

> 🎥 **Not Just Record — Record. Render. Release.**

FinalCast is an open-source, full-stack podcasting and video conversation platform built with the **MERN stack**, **WebRTC**, and **FFmpeg** — designed to provide creators with a **fully rendered video** after every session, without needing to manually edit timeline chunks.

---

## 🚀 Why FinalCast?

While tools like Riverside.fm are powerful, they require creators or editors to manually stitch together video chunks after every session.

🧠 FinalCast aims to **solve that pain** by:
- Recording video and audio locally
- Uploading via **S3 multipart**
- Dynamically adjusting layout as participants join/leave
- Rendering a clean, editor-ready video at the end using **FFmpeg**

> Aimed at creators, teams, and developers who want full control without costly software dependencies.
