# FinalCast Recording System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Complete Implementation

### 1. Client-Side MediaRecorder (`frontend/src/hooks/userMediaRecorder.js`)
- **Real-time recording** of participant's local video + audio stream during video calls
- **3-second chunk splitting** using MediaRecorder API
- **Automatic upload** of each chunk to Cloudinary with pre-signed URLs
- **Error handling** and recording status tracking
- **Chunk counting** for progress indication

### 2. Backend Recording API (`backend/routes/recordingRoutes.js`)
- **`POST /api/get-upload-url`** - Generates secure Cloudinary upload URLs
- **`POST /api/chunk-uploaded`** - Tracks chunk metadata in database
- **`POST /api/merge-chunks`** - FFmpeg-based chunk merging into final videos
- **`GET /api/session/{sessionId}/videos`** - Lists final videos for session
- **`GET /api/download/{publicId}`** - Generates secure download URLs

### 3. Database Models (`backend/models/recording.model.js`)
- **RecordingChunk** - Tracks individual chunk metadata
- **FinalRecording** - Stores final merged video information
- **Proper indexing** for efficient queries

### 4. Studio Integration (`frontend/src/components/Main/StudioRoomComplete.jsx`)
- **Recording controls** integrated into ControlBar
- **Real-time status** showing recording state and chunk count
- **Error handling** with toast notifications
- **Automatic cleanup** when recording stops

### 5. Dashboard Video Display (`frontend/src/components/studio/SessionRecordings.jsx`)
- **Host-only access** to recorded videos
- **Video metadata** display (duration, size, creation date, participant info)
- **Download functionality** with progress indication
- **Bulk download** option for all recordings
- **Compact mode** for dashboard integration
- **Role-based visual indicators** (host vs participant recordings)

### 6. Content Management Dashboard (`frontend/src/components/Main/content.jsx`)
- **"Your Content" page** accessible from main dashboard
- **Complete session management** with recording downloads
- **Search and filter** functionality for sessions
- **Expandable recording sections** for each session
- **Session metadata** display (status, participants, dates)
- **Quick access** to session details and recordings

### 7. Session Details Integration
- **SessionRecordings component** integrated into session details page
- **Participant information** linked to recordings
- **Role-based access** (only hosts can see recordings)

## 🎯 Key Features

### Recording Process
1. **Start Recording**: Click record button → MediaRecorder starts → 3s chunks upload to Cloudinary
2. **Live Feedback**: Recording indicator, chunk count, error messages
3. **Stop Recording**: Triggers server-side FFmpeg merge → Final video uploaded
4. **Auto Cleanup**: Original chunks deleted after successful merge

### Dashboard Access
1. **"Your Content" Dashboard**: Navigate from main dashboard to content management
2. **Session Overview**: View all your hosted sessions with status and metadata
3. **Recording Downloads**: Expand any session to see available recordings
4. **Bulk Operations**: Download all recordings or individual files
5. **Search & Filter**: Find specific sessions by name, status, or date

### Storage Structure
```
Cloudinary:
sessions/{sessionId}/
├── host/chunk_0_timestamp.webm
├── participant-{uid}/chunk_1_timestamp.webm
└── final/
    ├── host_{participantId}.mp4
    └── participant_{participantId}.mp4
```

### Database Storage
- **Persistent chunk tracking** (no in-memory storage)
- **Final video metadata** with participant links
- **Processing status** tracking

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Flow
```
useMediaRecorder Hook
└── MediaRecorder API (3s chunks)
    ├── Get upload URL from backend
    ├── Upload chunk to Cloudinary
    └── Notify backend of successful upload
```

### Backend Flow
```
Chunk Upload
├── Generate signed Cloudinary URL
├── Track chunk in database
└── Return upload parameters

Merge Process
├── Query chunks from database
├── Download chunks from Cloudinary
├── FFmpeg concatenation
├── Upload final video
└── Cleanup chunks
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Page (`/recording-test`)
- **Isolated testing** environment
- **Mock session data** for development
- **Visual feedback** for recording status
- **Manual trigger** for video checking

### Test Workflow
1. Navigate to `/recording-test`
2. Grant camera/microphone permissions
3. Start recording for 10+ seconds
4. Stop recording and wait for merge
5. Check videos to verify final output

## 📋 Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Client-side MediaRecorder** for each participant
✅ **Real-time recording** during video calls  
✅ **3-second chunk splitting** and upload
✅ **Cloudinary integration** with pre-signed URLs
✅ **Session-specific folder structure**
✅ **Server-side FFmpeg merging** 
✅ **Final video storage** in organized folders
✅ **Host dashboard** with download links
✅ **"Your Content" page** for session management

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Install FFmpeg** on your system (see RECORDING_SETUP.md)
2. **Configure Cloudinary** credentials in backend .env
3. **Test recording** using the test page or studio room
4. **Monitor logs** for chunk uploads and merge processes
5. **Verify final videos** appear in session details

The recording system is now fully implemented and ready for testing!
